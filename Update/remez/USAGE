remez a b reqp n low high prec

Generate a sequence of optimal rational approximations for the same function
(see below for details) of increasing order (>=n) in intervals having a common
upper bound (high) and a lower bound such that the relative error of the 
approximation is reqp. The sequence end when the order is such that the lower
bound for the approximation is less than low.

approximate the function f(x)=x^(+-a/b)
reqp => every approx generated has the required precision (within 1%)
n => start with an approximation of order n, and then increase n
low => stop when an approximation has been found with lower bound < low
high => common upper bound of all approximations

prec => precision used in numerical computation (usually 100)
